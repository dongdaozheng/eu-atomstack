                  your browser to refuse cookies from websites or to remove cookies from your hard drive, but if you do,
                  you will not be able to access or use portions of the Site. We have to use cookies to enable you to
                  select products, place them in an online shopping cart, and to purchase those products. If you do
                  this, we keep a record of your browsing activity and purchase. THE SITE’S COOKIES DO NOT AND CAN NOT
                  INFILTRATE A USER’S HARD DRIVE TO GATHER A USER’S CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. Our cookies are not

                  (ii) Web beacons assist in delivering cookies and help us determine whether a web page on the Site has
                  been viewed and, if so, how many times. For example, any electronic image on the Site, such as an ad
                  banner, can function as a web beacon.

                  effectiveness (such as which web pages are visited or what products are purchased and in what amount).
                  Any information that these third parties collect via cookies and web beacons is not linked to any

                  As you might expect from us, the majority of information that we collect is obtained through the Site,
                  and this Privacy Policy applies only to that online collection of personal information. We also may
                  collect information offline, where we also try to protect the privacy of your personal information.
                  One example involves someone calling us to place an order or to ask questions. When someone calls, we
                  will ask only for the personal information we need in order to place the order or to answer the
                  question. When we need to store information (such as order information), we will enter it into our
                  database through SSL encryption. (See the Data Security section above for more information). Another
                  example involves faxes. If you fax something to us, we will act upon the fax and then either store it
                  in a locked repository or we will shred the fax if there is no need to retain the information. There
                  are other ways we could learn personal information offline (for example, we suppose someone could send
                  us a letter including some return address information), and this Policy doesn’t discuss or try to
                  predict all of those methods or uses. As we mentioned, we will try to treat offline collection, uses,
                  and disclosures consistently with our relevant online practices.
