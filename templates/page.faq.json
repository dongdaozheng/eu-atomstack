R1, R2, and R3 cater to different needs; R1 is suitable for cylindrical engraving like cans or irregular objects, while R2 fits various standard bottle sizes. R3 PRO adds support columns for engraving irregularly shaped cups, like goblets.

Sometimes, during the OS installation, generic drivers are selected, which may not support the functionality of certain connected devices. It's crucial to install the recommended drivers for your computer from the manufacturer's official page.<\/li><li>Have you installed the CH340 driver? Regardless of your operating system, ensure you install this driver; otherwise, the laser won't operate within normal parameters. For Windows users, upon installing the LaserGRBL program, you'll gain access to the latest version of this driver.<br\/>If Windows automatically installed a generic driver for your laser, install the LaserGRBL program, uninstall the driver, and then reinstall it. (Tools =&gt; Install CH340 Driver)<\/li><li>Double-check that you've selected the correct COM port and confirmed that the Baud Rate is set to 115200.<\/li><li>If you're using a Mac computer, you might require a Type-C to USB converter to connect the cable.<\/li><\/ul>"

Manufacturers must also use lower-quality wood sheets, which are hidden in the inner layers.
